# Dexterity App

This is my first application built on my own rather than from a tutorial or as part of a group.

My goals are to use:
-  Ruby on Rails framework
-  MySQL as a database
-  Devise to create user authentication
-  Heroku for deployment
-  ClearDB (?) to use MySQL w/Heroku

The goal of the app is to allow logged-in users to complete dexterity tests, record their times, and allow them to view a chart of all their times as well as an overall leaderboard.
