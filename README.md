# Dexterity App

This is my first application built on my own rather than from a tutorial or as part of a group.

My goals are to use:
-  Ruby on Rails framework
-  MySQL as a database
-  Devise to create user authentication
-  Heroku for deployment
-  ClearDB to use MySQL w/Heroku
-  jQuery and Ajax for front-end dexterity tests

The goal of the app is to allow logged-in users to complete dexterity tests, record their times, and allow them to view a chart of all their times as well as an overall leaderboard.

Check out the app (in progress): [http://dexterity-test.herokuapp.com](http://dexterity-test.herokuapp.com).
